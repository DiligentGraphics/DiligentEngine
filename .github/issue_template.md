If you have build or run problems, please read [troubleshooting](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine/blob/master/Troubleshooting.md) first.

Please double-check that your [code is up-to-date, including all submodules](https://github.com/DiligentGraphics/DiligentEngine#cloning-the-repository).

If you have a question that does not require creating an issue, you may ask it on [discord](https://discord.gg/t7HGBK7).

For performance issues, please make sure you are running release builds. Debug builds may be significantly slower, especially on Windows.

For GPU-related problems, please make sure you have up-to-date drivers.

Please provide the following information:

- OS and version you are running (e.g. Windows 10.0.18362, MacOS Catalina 10.15, etc.)
- Build tools and configuration you used to build the engine (e.g. Visual Studio 2017 Debug x64 + CMake 3.15.4)
- GPU and driver version you have installed on your system
- Debug output, especially messages from Diligent
- Call stack (if available)
- If you experience a problem with one back-end, please try running other back-ends and see if the same issue arises
