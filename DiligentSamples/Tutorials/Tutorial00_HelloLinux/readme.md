# Tutorial00 - Hello Linux

This tutorial demonstrates how to initialize Diligent Engine and render a simple triangle on Linux platform. 
It is similar to [Tutorial01](../Tutorial01_HelloTriangle), but the project has no dependencies other than 
on Diligent-GraphicsEngineOpenGL-shared and Diligent-GraphicsEngineVk-shared and all the code is contained in a single file.
