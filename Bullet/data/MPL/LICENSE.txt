    This file and the .stl mesh files referenced from it have been derived by Roboti LLC from the model of the Modular Prosthetic Limb developed by The Johns Hopkins University / Applied Physics Laboratory. The modifications are as follows: the original meshes have been replaced with their convex hulls; the original URDF model has been converted to the MJCF format and a number of MJCF-specific fields have been added.

    The Johns Hopkins University / Applied Physics Laboratory has given Roboti LLC permission to distribute the modified model under the following license:
