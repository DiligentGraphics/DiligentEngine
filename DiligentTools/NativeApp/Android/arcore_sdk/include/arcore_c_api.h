/// @defgroup concepts Concepts
/// High-Level concepts of ARCore
///
/// @section ownership Object ownership
///
/// ARCore has two categories of objects: "value types" and "reference types".
///
/// - Value types are owned by application. They are created and destroyed using
///   the @c create / @c destroy methods, and are populated by ARCore using
///   methods with @c get in the method name.
///
/// - Reference types are owned by ARCore. A reference is acquired by one of the
///   @c acquire methods.  For each call to the @c acquire method, the
///   application must call the matching @c release method. Note that even if
///   the last reference is released, ARCore may continue to hold a reference to
///   the object at ARCore's discretion.
///
/// Reference types are further split into:
///
/// - Long-lived objects. These objects persist across frames, possibly for the
///   life span of the application or session. Acquire may fail if ARCore is in
///   an incorrect state, e.g. not tracking. Acquire from list always succeeds,
///   as the object already exists.
///
/// - Transient large data. These objects are usually acquired per-frame and are
///   a limited resource. The @c acquire call may fail if the resource is
///   exhausted (too many are currently held), deadline exceeded (the target of
///   the acquire was already released), or the resource is not yet available.
///
/// Note: Lists are value types (owned by application), but can hold references
/// to long-lived objects. This means that the references held by a list are not
/// released until either the list is destroyed, or is re-populated by another
/// api call.
///
/// For example, ::ArAnchorList, which is a value type, will hold references to
/// Anchors, which are long-lived objects.
///
/// @section spaces Poses and Coordinate Spaces
///
/// An @c ArPose describes an rigid transformation from one coordinate space to
/// another. As provided from all ARCore APIs, Poses always describe the
/// transformation from object's local coordinate space to the <b>world
/// coordinate space</b> (see below). That is, Poses from ARCore APIs can be
/// thought of as equivalent to OpenGL model matrices.
///
/// The transformation is defined using a quaternion rotation about the origin
/// followed by a translation.
///
/// The coordinate system is right-handed, like OpenGL conventions.
///
/// Translation units are meters.
///
/// @section worldcoordinates World Coordinate Space
///
/// As ARCore's understanding of the environment changes, it adjusts its model
/// of the world to keep things consistent. When this happens, the numerical
/// location (coordinates) of the camera and anchors can change significantly to
/// maintain appropriate relative positions of the physical locations they
/// represent.
///
/// These changes mean that every frame should be considered to be in a
/// completely unique world coordinate space. The numerical coordinates of
/// anchors and the camera should never be used outside the rendering frame
/// during which they were retrieved. If a position needs to be considered
/// beyond the scope of a single rendering frame, either an anchor should be
/// created or a position relative to a nearby existing anchor should be used.
