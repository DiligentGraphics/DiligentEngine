// In c++11, the following struct is not an aggregate:
//      struct S1
//      {
//          int a = 0;
//      };
// S1 is an aggregate in c++14.
//
// Likewise, the following struct is not an aggregate in c++11:
//      struct S2 : Aggregate
//      {
//          int b;
//      };
// S2 is an aggregate in c++17
//
// When compiling non-aggregates, the compiler may mess with the member placement.
// For example, consider the example below:
//      struct S1
//      {
//          void* p = nullptr;
//          int   a = 0;
//          // <implicit 4-byte padding>
//      };
//      struct S2 : S1
//      {
//          int b = 0;
//      };
//
// When compiling S2 with x64 gcc, it will place 'b' right after 'a', not after the end of struct S1.
// We try to catch such issues below
